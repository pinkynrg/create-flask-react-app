# Create Flask React App

Welcome to the **Create Flask React App** project! This project provides a simple and efficient way to bootstrap a new web application that combines Flask for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create and start your new application:

### 1. Generate a New Application

To generate a new Flask-React application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create flask-react@latest
```

This command will guide you through a few questions to customize your project setup.

### 2. Answer the Questions

As the script runs, it will prompt you with a series of questions to configure your new project. Provide the necessary details to tailor the application to your needs.

### 3. Navigate to the Project Directory

After the project has been generated, navigate into the newly created directory:

```bash
cd <your-project-directory>
```

Replace `<your-project-directory>` with the actual name of the directory that was created during the setup.

### 4. Start the Application

Once inside the project directory, you can start the application by running:

```bash
make start
```

This command will launch both the Flask backend and the React frontend, allowing you to begin developing your application.

## Additional Information

- **Backend**: The project uses Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, for the backend.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Feel free to explore and customize the generated project to suit your needs. Happy coding!
